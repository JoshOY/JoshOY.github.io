	<h3>The situation of PE in universities is terrible</h3>
	<p>Using real examples: Our "terrible" experiences on physical testing last month.</p>
	<p>Giving statistics to visualize the problem.</p>

	<h3>Problems of current PE in universities (Better using statistics to prove I'm not lying)</h3>
	<p>Analyse: Why the standard is becoming more and more strict while the overall physical quality of students are getting is declining.</p>
	<p>One reason is that the department of education wants to encourage students to pay more attention to physical training. But they are using a wrong method, by adjusting the standard more and more strict than before. That make students afraid of sports.</p>
	<p>And middle school education in China is really stressful, so that most students can't get enough time for physical training. But universities ignored it and put forward a unrealistic demands on physical standard of students.</p>
	<p>Another problem is that some students are regarding PE as a mission, not an interest.</p>
	<p>The last one is that the test items are always the same one(1km running, etc.). While some students can do better on other items are overwhelmed and lose confidence. </p>

	<h3>How to deal with it, and why it's correct (Giving the solution and persuade)</h3>
	<p>As we can see from above, the system of PE in universities does need  a reform.</p>
	<p>Firstly, we need a new standard of physical test.</p>
	<p>Different students have different advantages on sports. And we can't using a simple standard to judge whether he is good or not. Why don't we give more test items and let some of them optional? Students can choose the items they are good at and maybe they'll love these sports later on.</p>
	<p>Secondly, focusing bonus rather than punishment. It's not a good idea to deprive graduate qualification if the student failed in the test. That only make students hate the test. But if we use bonus to encourage students to try hard and do better, that'll be useful.</p>
	<p>Finally, ...</p>

	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<p>Physical education in Chinese universities has been a serious problem for many years.</p>
	<p>We can't ignore it, or using a simple and crude way to force students focusing on PE.</p>
	<p>So we need to reform the PE system. Try to use more encouragment methods, rather than punishment.</p>
